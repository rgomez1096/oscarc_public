# Feeback Cache
## Purpose
A problem that I, along with other high school English teachers is keeping track of feedback we have given as well as creating a cache of feedback that we constantly and consistently give to students on their writing.

My program will serve as a system to store common feedback we give out often (e.g., Grammar/Mechanics, Structure, Integration of sources, etc.), keep track of which feedback was given to which student, as well as catergorize feedback to ease with assigning feedback.

## User Input
My program will require the following user inputs:
1. Allow user to enter and store feedback objects, i.e., categorizing a type of feedback and entering a basic description of the feedback.
2. Allow a user to enter student info and retrieve what kind of feedback was given to that particular student
3. Allow user to see all feedback stored in system
4. Allow user to see students stored in system
